\section{Crystal structure of Zircon/Zirconium(IV)silicate (ZrSiO4)}
\label{sec:ZrSiO4}

The peak profiling for the data for Zircon was done using the le Bail-wizard from \textit{Jana2006}. Here, the profiling was not ideal: Due to the $K\alpha$ doublet each peak consisted of two subpeaks. Strangely, the distance between the $2\theta$ values of those two peaks did not match the calculated $2\theta$-distance between the $K\alpha$ lines. Therefore, the fitting algorithm calculated basically one pseudo-Voigt curve for each peak instead of a composition of two [Fig. \ref{fig:demoShitPeaks}] and the wRp value never fell below 30. Anyhow, we continued refining the structure using the Rietveld-wizard of \textit{Jana2006}. The refined parameters are
\begin{gather*}
    \boxed{a = b = 6.608\,\mathrm{\AA} \quad c = 5.988\,\mathrm{\AA}}~.
\end{gather*}
The result is the profile shown in Fig. \ref{fig:ZrSiO4Prof}. In this Figure it can be clearly seen, that the profiling was not completely successful since the plot of the difference shows a few very high values near the peaks. This could either be due to an unskilled usage of \textit{Jana2006} or an unknown variation in the setup. In spite of this, the structure of Zircon [Fig. \ref{fig:ZrSiO4Struct}] aligns to the Ref. \citenum{Hanchar2003}. The typical ZrO\textsubscript{8} trigondodecahedra and the SiO\textsubscript{4} tetrahedra are highlighted in the polyhedral figure style.

        Due to the different distances between the $K\alpha$ lines and the two subpeaks of each peak, the profile could not be calculated exactly, but just as one pseudo-Voigt curve instead of a composition of two.
