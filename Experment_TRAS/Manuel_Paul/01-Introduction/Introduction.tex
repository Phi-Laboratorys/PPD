Transient absorption spectroscopy is a powerful technique used in various scientific fields to investigate the dynamic behavior of molecules and materials. By probing the absorption properties of a sample in an excited state, transient absorption spectroscopy gives insight into details of photoinduced phenomena, such as energy transfer, charge carrier dynamics, and molecular structural changes. It enables researchers to explore fundamental processes and devise strategies for improving a wide range of technologies.

In this lab practice, we explore this method with the material ZnTPP (zinc tetraphenylporphyrin), ZnOEP (zinc octaethylporphyrin) and P3HT (poly(3-hexylthiophene)). Goal of this experiment is to get a deeper insight into the decay rate and lifetime of triplet states and to investigate the possible influnces in those properties. Additionally, UV-VIS spectroscopy will be performed to explain the phenomenas observed in the transient absorption.
